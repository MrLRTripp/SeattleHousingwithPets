## Conclusion

Dog ownership percentage in ZIP codes is highly correlated with owner occupancy percentage. Moderatly correlated with ZIP codes that have 3 bedrooms and Median rent amounts in the ZIP codes.

Moderatly *negatively* correlated with areas that have no bedrooms or 1 bedroom.

Interestingly, not much of a correlation with owner occupied property value.
